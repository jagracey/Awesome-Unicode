# Glossary of Unicode Terms
*These Unicode terms have been taken from the Unicode Consortium's [glossary](http://www.unicode.org/glossary/).*

### A

<strong><a id="abjad" href="#abjad">Abjad</a></strong>: A writing system in which only consonants are indicated. The term “abjad” is derived from the first four letters of the traditional order of the Arabic script: *alef, beh, jeem, dal*. (See [Section 6.1, Writing Systems](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch06.pdf#G7382).)

<strong><a id="abstract_character" href="#abstract_character">Abstract Character</a></strong>: A unit of information used for the organization, control, or representation of textual data. (See definition D7 in [Section 3.4, Characters and Encoding](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch03.pdf#G2212).)

<strong><a id="abstract_character_sequence" href="#abstract_character_sequence">Abstract Character Sequence</a></strong>: An ordered sequence of one or more abstract characters. (See definition D8 in Section [Section 3.4, Characters and Encoding](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch03.pdf#G2212).)

<strong><a id="abugida" href="#abugida">Abugida</a></strong>: A writing system in which consonants are indicated by the base letters that have an inherent vowel, and in which other vowels are indicated by additional distinguishing marks of some kind modifying the base letter. The term “abugida” is derived from the first four letters of the Ethiopic script in the Semitic order: *alf, bet, gaml, dant*. (See [Section 6.1, Writing Systems](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch06.pdf#G7382).)

<strong><a id="accent_mark" href="#accent_mark">Accent Mark</a></strong>: A mark placed above, below, or to the side of a character to alter its phonetic value. (See also *[diacritic](GLOSSARY.md#diacritic)*.)

<strong><a id="acrophonic" href="#acrophonic">Acrophonic</a></strong>: Denoting letters or numbers by the first letter of their name. For example, the Greek acrophonic numerals are variant forms of such initial letters.

<strong><a id="aksara" href="#aksara">Aksara</a></strong>: (1) In Sanskrit grammar, the term for “letter” in general, as opposed to consonant (*vyanjana*) or vowel (*svara*). Derived from the first and last letters of the traditional ordering of Sanskrit letters—“a” and “ksha”. (2) More generally, in Indic writing systems, *aksara* refers to a “syllable,” consisting of a consonant plus vowel sequence, where the vowel may or may not be the inherent vowel of the consonant letter. When multiple consonants are involved, the *aksara* represents the entire orthographic syllable, which can include two or more leading consonants that may be visually presented in conjunct forms; in such cases, the *aksara* may not be identical to the phonological syllable.

<strong><a id="algorithm" href="#algorithm">Algorithm</a></strong>: A term used in a broad sense in the Unicode Standard, to mean the logical description of a process used to achieve a specified result. This does not require the actual procedure described in the algorithm to be followed; any implementation is conformant as long as the results are the same.

<strong><a id="alphabet" href="#alphabet">Alphabet</a></strong>: A writing system in which both consonants and vowels are indicated. The term “alphabet” is derived from the first two letters of the Greek script: *alpha, beta*. (See [Section 6.1, Writing Systems](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch06.pdf#G7382).)

<strong><a id="alphabetic_property" href="#alphabetic_property">Alphabetic Property</a></strong>: Informative property of the primary units of alphabets and/or syllabaries. (See [Section 4.10, Letters, Alphabetic, and Ideographic](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch04.pdf#G91002).)

<strong><a id="ANSI" href="#ANSI">ANSI</a></strong>: (1) The American National Standards Institute. (2) The Microsoft collective name for all Windows code pages. Sometimes used specifically for code page 1252, which is a superset of ISO/IEC 8859-1.

<strong><a id="arabic_digits" href="#arabic_digits">Arabic Digits</a></strong>: The term "Arabic digits" may mean either the digits in the Arabic script (see *[Arabic-Indic digits](GLOSSARY.md#arabic_indic_digits)*) or the ordinary ASCII digits in contrast to Roman numerals (see *[European digits](GLOSSARY.md#european_digits)*). When the term "Arabic digits" is used in Unicode specifications, it means Arabic-Indic digits.

Although *[European digits](GLOSSARY.md#european_digits)* (1, 2, 3,…) derive historically from these forms, they are visually distinct and are coded separately. (Arabic-Indic digits are sometimes called Indic numerals; however, this nomenclature leads to confusion with the digits currently used with the scripts of India.) Variant forms of Arabic-Indic digits used chiefly in Iran and Pakistan are referred to as *Eastern Arabic-Indic digits*. (See [Section 9.2, Arabic](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch09.pdf#G20596).)

(2) The set of 128 Unicode characters from U+0000 to U+007F, including control codes as well as graphic characters. (3) ASCII has been incorrectly used to refer to various 8-bit character encodings that include ASCII characters in the first 128 code points.

In Western contexts these are often turned sideways, as :-) to express a happy face; in East Asian contexts other conventions often portray a facial expression without turning, as ^-^. Rendering systems often recognize conventional emoticon sequences and display them as colorful or even animated glyphs in text. There is also a set of dedicated pictographic symbols—mostly representing different facial expressions—encoded as characters in the Unicode Standard. (See *[pictograph](GLOSSARY.md#pictograph)*.)

(See definition D11 in [Section 3.4, Characters and Encoding](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch03.pdf#G2212).)
